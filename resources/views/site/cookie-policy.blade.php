                <p>Cookies are data files that are sent between web servers and web browsers, processor memory or hard
                    drives (clients) to recognise a particular user’s device when the user accesses a website. They are
                    used for a range of different purposes, such as customising a website for a particular user, helping
                    a user navigate a website, improving that user’s website experience, and storing that user’s
                    preferences and login information.</p>
                <p>Cookies can be classified as either ‘session’ or ‘persistent’ cookies. Session cookies are placed on
                    your browser when you access a website and last for as long as you keep your browser open. They
                    expire when you close your browser.</p>
                <p>Persistent cookies are placed on your computer when you access a website and expire at a fixed point
                    in time or if you manually delete them from your browser, whichever occurs first.</p>

                    by us on our website domain are referred to as ‘first party’ cookies. Cookies set by third party
                    domains or set on or via our website domain on behalf of third parties are referred to as ‘third
                    party’ cookies.</p>
                <p>Cookies do not usually contain personal information. Cookies may, however, be used in combination
                    with other information to identify you.</p>
                <p>We use first party and third party cookies on our website, and both session and persistent cookies.
